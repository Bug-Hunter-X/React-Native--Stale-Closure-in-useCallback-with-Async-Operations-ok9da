The solution involves using the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array to perform the data fetching after the component mounts.  This ensures that the data is fetched only once, avoiding potential race conditions and stale closures. We also use a loading state to manage the UI while the data is being fetched.  This approach cleanly handles the asynchronous operation, providing a better user experience.
