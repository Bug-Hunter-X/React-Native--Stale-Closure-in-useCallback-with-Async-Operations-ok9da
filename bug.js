This React Native code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the interaction between `useCallback` and asynchronous operations within a component. The `fetchData` function, memoized using `useCallback`, fetches data asynchronously. However, if the component re-renders before the promise resolves, `data` might not be updated correctly. This is because the memoized `fetchData` function retains its original state, and the data might not be reflected in the subsequent render.
