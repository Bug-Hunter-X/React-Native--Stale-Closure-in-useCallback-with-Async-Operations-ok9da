This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications involving the use of `useCallback` with asynchronous operations.  The bug arises from the fact that `useCallback` memoizes the function, but doesn't guarantee data consistency if the asynchronous operation isn't completed before a re-render. This leads to stale closure, meaning the function uses outdated data. The solution showcases a better approach to handling this asynchronous operation within the `useCallback` hook.
